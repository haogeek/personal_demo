Personal code demo

### deploy system
This is a tool that built with some inspiration from Domain-Driven Design and IOC. I also use context manager in this demo.

### nuke project package
This is a demo using multi-threading and MVC design pattern. I create a thread pool to safely manage all threads, and a mechanism to log out all already-been-copied things when the tool been accidently closed.

### nukestudio_buildtrack
This is also a MVC demo but it shows out how I know third-party API (hiero API in this example) and related domain knowledge.

Of course there're more works that I can not publish to GitHub, but I believe these demo projects could help showing the code style and thinking of me.
